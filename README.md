This repository contains files which can be used to model the growth of polymers according to a self avoiding random walk. The project was created as part of the course Computational Physics at TU Delft.
The important files for the simulation are [main.py](main.py), [functions.py](functions.py) and [plot_functions.py](plot_functions.py).
To run the simulation you need to run [main.py](main.py). This file contains all the parameters of the system. The code
itself is exectued using the other two python files that contain functions, so you need to have the three python files in one folder.

A report about the project can be read [here](Polymer_growth.pdf). In the report the methods and results are discussed.
